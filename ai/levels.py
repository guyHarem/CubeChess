"""
The three levels of the computer player, and the one function the rest of the program calls.

Weaker levels are weaker because they see less far and choose among several good-looking
moves, not because they play well and then blunder on purpose.

| level  | looks ahead                         | picks                                        |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| easy   | 1 move, without following captures  | at random among moves within 1.5 pawns       |
| medium | 2 moves, following captures         | at random among moves within 0.3 pawns       |
| hard   | as deep as the time allows          | the best move (some variety in the opening)  |
