"""
Scoring a position for the computer player, in hundredths of a pawn.

The score is material plus a value for where each piece stands. FastBoard keeps it up to
date on every move, so reading it costs nothing.

Every number that goes into it is a named parameter in DEFAULT_PARAMS. Each piece on each
square has a list of features (how many squares it reaches from there, how far it is from
the Ground, how far a pawn has advanced...), and its value is the sum of feature x parameter.
That makes the numbers tunable: tools/tune.py plays the computer against itself and fits
the parameters to who won.
